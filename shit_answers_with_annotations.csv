Generally speaking, employee handbooks do not create a contract, so an employer isn't necessarily liable for breaching the terms of his own employment agreement.  Regarding the defamation, these are usually the requirements:     1.  a publication to one other than the person defamed;    2. a false statement of fact;    3. that is understood as            a. being of and concerning the plaintiff; and           b. tending to harm the reputation of plaintiff.      4. If the plaintiff is a public figure, he or she must also prove actual malice.  To know for sure whether you have a case of defamation against your employer, you'll need to contact a lawyer in your area.","2008-11-05 14:17:12","2010-04-05 18:24:10",16766,27307,"na","64.81.170.31",3,0,NULL,0,NULL,1,0,0

60469,44234,"Unfortunately, you have a lot of company.  This is a typical scenario in child support cases.   You may have a couple of opportunities, but they are slim.   First, did your former spouse ever receive any sort of financail help from the county?  AFDC? TANF? or some other type of welfare.  If so, I suspect a great amount of what you owe is to reimburse the county government, not your ex.    If that is the case, there was a program that enables you to reach a compromise and is known as ""Compromise of Arrears Program"" (COAP) Under this program, you may apply for the compromise of child support arrears owed to the government is the ""Compromise of Arrears Program” (COAP). Authorized by statute (Family Code §17560) in 2003, this program went into effect July 1, 2005. If an applicant qualifies for compromise under this program, his public assistance arrearages may be compromised up to 90%. These arrears are not compromised 100% and if current support is still owed, the obligor must stay current with his current support payment as well as the agreed upon repayment amount.  The purpose of the COAP program is to allow child support agencies to concentrate on collecting current support that is owed to families. It reduces the debt of the obligor to ensure that he is able to pay current support owed to his family and it reduces the burden on State and County agencies to collect arrears that are in reality uncollectible. 									 The criteria that you must meet to qualify for COAP is as follows:  1) The amount of permanently assigned arrears (any aid type) owed by the applicant to the government is in excess of $5,000.00.  2) There has not been a previous application to participate in COAP within one year prior to the date of application.  3) There has not been a rescission of a previous COAP agreement within two years prior to the date of application.  4) The applicant has not been found guilty of contempt for failure to pay child support within 6 months of the application.  5) The applicant has only one child support case in California’s child support program.  6) The child support case cannot be a two state, interstate case.  7). The applicant cannot have intentionally failed to pay child support in anticipation of COAP.  8) The applicant has no ability or reasonable expectation of ability to pay all child support arrears and interest owed within three years. (This is a calculation that the program's computer makes based on applicants' income, debt and assets.)  9) The applicant has not concealed his income or assets and has not intentionally withheld or falsified his financial information.  10) The applicant has the ability to pay from any source within a three year period from the date of the agreement;   a) Current support    b) Arrears owed to custodial parent    c) The repayment amount (the portion of government arrears obligor must pay in order to receive a compromise)   On the other hand, if you owe only for support payabel to your ex wife, and no government reimbursement, then the only person who can relieve you from the debt is your former wife.   The court cannot reduce support or interest retroactively, but your former wife can reach an agreement and stipulate that you have met your obligation (paid your debt) and close the DCSS case.   This is probably unlikely, but then again, it is possible.  Good Luck.","2009-02-22 15:08:36","2012-04-23 22:47:35",51139,51139,"Removing the answer so lawyer can repost with correct link","70.181.67.242",3,0,NULL,0,NULL,1,3.5,0

81113,61111,"Sister in Christ, the problem that you may have is that if the custody was fought in Iowa, and the children are in Iowa, you will need to contact an attorney in Iowa. May the Lord bless you and give you the strength to handle your situation. Here is something for you:   A young woman went to her mother and told her about her life and how things were so hard for her.. She   did not know how she was going to make it and wanted to give up, She was tired of fighting and   struggling.. It seemed as one problem was solved, a new one arose.     Her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire. Soon   the pots came to boil. In the first she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs, and in the   last she placed ground coffee beans. She let them sit and boil; without saying a word.     In about twenty minutes she turned off the burners. She fished the carrots out and placed them in a   bowl. She pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl. Then she ladled the coffee out and placed it   in a bowl. Turning to her daughter, she asked, ""Tell me what you see.."" ""Carrots, eggs, and coffee,"" she   replied.     Her mother brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She did and noted that they were soft.   The mother then asked the daughter to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she   observed the hardboiled egg.     Finally, the mother asked the daughter to sip the coffee. The daughter smiled as she tasted its rich   aroma.. The daughter then asked, 'What does it mean, mother?'     Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same adversity: boiling water. Each   reacted differently. The carrot went in strong , hard, and unrelenting. However, after being   subjected to the boiling water, it softened and became weak. The egg had been fragile. Its thin   outer shell had protected its liquid interior, but after sitting through the boiling water, its inside   became hardened. The ground coffee beans were unique, however. After they were in the boiling   water, they had changed the water.     ""Which are you?"" she asked her daughter. When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond?   Are you a carrot, an egg or a coffee bean?     Think of this: Which am I? Am I the carrot that seems strong, but with pain and adversity do I wilt   and become soft and lose my strength?     Am I the egg that starts with a malleable heart, but changes with the heat? Did I have a fluid spirit,   but after a death, a breakup, a financial hardship or some other trial, have I become hardened and   stiff? Does my shell look the same, but on the inside am I bitter and tough with a stiff spirit and   hardened heart?!     Or am I like the coffee bean? The bean actually changes the hot water, the very circumstance that   brings the pain.. When the water gets hot, it releases the fragrance and flavor. If you are like   the bean, when things are at their worst, you get better and change the situation around you.. When the   hour is the darkest and trials are their greatest, do you elevate yourself to another level? How do you   handle adversity? Are you a carrot, an egg or a coffee bean?","2009-04-14 11:21:34","2012-04-23 23:41:19",7523,93020,"-Jeannie 5/7/09","75.38.52.115",3,0,NULL,0,NULL,1,4.5,0

89876,62009,"There are several issues here.   I practice in Maryland and the District of Columbia, so my answer is based on what would typically happen in those jurisdictions.  I do not practice in TN, so you will want to consult an attorney who does practice there.  But, these are the general issues I see.    Generally, co-signers on a loan are liable for payment, even if there was an informal understanding between co-signers that only one of them would be making the payments.  But, how was the loan addressed in the terms of your divorce? This may affect your analysis.  To answer your question about garnishments:  the law on garnishments varies from jurisdiction to  jurisdiction.  Again, you will want to consult a TN attorney.    But, usually the lender must sue you and get a judgment against you before it can garnish your checking account or paycheck or file a lien on your real estate.  If the lender does sue you, be sure to attend your court date and explain your situation, even if you do not have an attorney.  The court may be willing to grant you some relief based on the facts you describe.  But, whatever you do, DO NOT ignore a court date.  Even if you cannot afford an attorney, you should attend all court dates and tell your side of the story.  Finally, you will want to research whether deficiency judgments are possible in Tennessee.  A deficiency judgment happens when a car is repossessed and sold, but the sales proceeds are not enough to satisfy the amount the former car owner owed under the original sales contract.  So, the lender sues the former car owner for the difference.    But, not all jurisdictions permit deficiency judgments.  If deficiency judgments are not possible in Tennessee, this may change your analysis.  There are likely other issues as well.  This post is meant to be a starting point for your research.  Good luck to you and call your county or state bar association if you need help finding an attorney in your area.  -- Karen Ware","2009-04-30 09:36:14","2009-04-30 11:01:00",53568,53568,"at the request of the atty - she checked with her ethics committee after answering","216.15.61.36",3,0,NULL,0,NULL,1,0,0
89906,68041,"Some background information before answering your question:  The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act does not prohibit debt collectors from ASKING consumers to pay debts that are beyond the statute of limitations for a lawsuit.  But, if the debt collector threatens to SUE on a time-barred debt, this may be an FDCPA violation.    Your state law may be more protective, however.  For example, your state may have an Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices statute that offers more protections for consumers being contacted by debt collectors about deb that's past the statute of limitations for a debt lawsuit.  But, back to you original question:  you have asked whether making sporadic payments extends (or ""tolls"") the statute of limitations on suing on old credit card debt.    The law in this area varies widely from state to state.   I practice in Maryland and the District of Columbia; I do not practice in Washington.  So, you will want to research your state law and possibly the federal law in the 9th Circuit to find out which actions will toll the statute of limitations there.  In some states, payments will toll the statute.  In some states, merely ""acknowledging the debt""  has been held to toll the statute.  On the other hand, in some states partial payments that do not bring an account ""current"" have been deemed NOT to toll the statute.  So, you will want to consult a Washington attorney to find out whether you have done anything to toll the statute.    As a general rule, however, consumers should not risk ""acknowledging"" debts.    If a debt collector contacts you by phone about an old debt, tell them to contact you in writing.  Do not give them any information over the phone.  Good luck to you.  Try contacting your county or state bar association if you need help finding an attorney in your area.  -- Karen Ware","2009-04-30 10:13:28","2009-04-30 11:00:35",53568,53568,"at the request of the atty - she checked with her ethics committee after answering","216.15.61.36",3,0,NULL,0,NULL,1,0,0

It does not matter if the loan is for business as these may be just as dischargeable as an unsecured personal loan. If it was secured, then it can’t be discharged, normally, but I suspect that this loan was not secured properly. In many jurisdictions, if the case was a no-asset Chapter 7 case, then all dischargeable debts may be wiped out regardless if they were not actually listed in the filing. This, as I noted, depends on the jurisdiction and more facts. As to reaffirming a debt, reaffirmation means a rather specific process under bankruptcy law. It is not the debtor merely telling someone that they will pay.

360570,276437,"To answer your question specifically in Massachusetts you may be able to get your record sealed.  Whether or not it actually gets sealed will depend on a few factors.    The way in which your original cases were disposed will play a role.  If the cases were resolved without any formal findings or probation you may be entitled to have them sealed.  If the case was resolved with a formal finding of guilt whether or not the record will be sealed will be highly dependent on the way your motion to seal is presented, and the judge who hears it.  You are best off seeking the services of a lawyer for a couple of reasons in your case.  A lawyer will be able to pull the court records of the courts you originally faced these charges in, and a lawyer will be able to tell you if those court records are in any way deficient which in and of itself may result in a judge sealing your record.  Often times older court records are not well kept and can be considered deficient.  Also an attorney will be able to make a plea on your behalf in front of the judge and present evidence to the court to try to put your recent good behavior and contributions to society in the best light possible for the judge that hears your motion.  Because both of your 1981 charges were likely misdemeanors, and more than 10 years has passed since the cases disposed a judge does have the authority to seal your record.  Even if your 1986 charge was a felony more than 15 years have passed, so a judge still has the authority to seal your record pursuant to Chapter 276 of the Massachusetts General Laws.  The fact that you have no incidents in the past 24 years does give you a decent shot at getting the record sealed, but the outcome of your motion will be highly dependent on the attorney that presents it and the attitude of the judge who hears it.  Keep in mind even if your motion to seal your record is granted it will only be sealed from individuals or organizations who seek your record from outside law enforcement and the courts.  Your criminal history will remain visible to the police and the courts.  However if the motion is granted potential employers that inquire about your record would be told that no record exists.  I wish you the best of luck with this issue.  Daniel Cappetta 508-318-8529","2010-05-31 17:50:27","2012-04-24 19:56:06",278983,275,"at the request of the atty cmc","66.30.73.28",3,0,2,0,NULL,1,3.5,0

429895,318173,"I practice in Georgia, not Hawaii, but most states provide at minimum, due process, that is personal notice of an adoption proceeding to the biological father.  If you do not know the biological father's whereabouts and cannot find him after a reasonable effort, then a family law attorney familiar with adoptions can request the judge to grant permission to provide notice to the biological father whose whereabouts are unknown by publication, the requirements of publication requiring the expertise of the lawyer to make sure it is done properly.  It may be that a father who has never seen or supported this child would be willing to sign a surrender of any parental rights he might have to the child for the purpose of the adoption.  Your local family law attorney can process the surrender paperwork properly.  Even if the biological father is unwilling to sign a surrender, your attorney will explain to you under what circumstances a Hawaiian court will terminate his rights, generally due to failure to develop a familial bond with the child or pay court-ordered child support.  It may be necessary for your attorney under Hawaiian law to request in writing a search by what Georgia and other states refer to as the Putative Father Index or Registry to see if any male has registered there claiming possible fatherhood of this child.  Any competent family law or adoption attorney will have to provide and explain to you with what in Georgia is called a Mother's Affidavit, another document that is necessary in Georgia stepparent adoptions.  You may have to also sign a Consent to the Adoption, another type document that is best left to the drafting capabilities of an attorney.  It is possible that Hawaii like Georgia requires children after a certain age to agree to their adoption and sign an affidavit of consent.  Again, your attorney should draft such a document if appropriate and assist with its execution by your child.  Generally speaking, a stepparent adoption presents reasonably straightforward legal tasks for your local family law or adoption attorney.  Any such competent family law or adoption  attorney should be willing to schedule a free consultation with you, your husband and the child to review the specific facts of your case and explain to you what will be necessary to successfully process your adoption filing.  Most importantly, that attorney should also be willing to list for you exactly what filing, court, home study, putative father search request, publication and other fees that will be incurred in processing your case, including cost of criminal FBI/HBI fingerprint report/s that may be required by Hawaii.  These fees are incidental to the adoption, over and above the attorney's legal fee for his service.  Ask all the questions, make sure you understand the legal strategy proposed by the attorney after reviewing all the facts and circumstance of your adoption.  That attorney should be willing as well to work out a payment plan since most adoptions take 60 - 90 days from filing to hearing.  Best of luck!     Bottom line, I would recommend that you at least sit down with your local family law attorney and see what he thinks will be necessary in order to legally process your husband's adoption of your child, given all the facts and circumstances of your case.   straightforward legal service that most any local attorney who specializes in family law can perform for you and your husband.

567165,404681,"First, it is always dangerous to start with advice from other states -- the Georgia lawyer, for example, begins with terminology that does not exist in Nevada.  here, by statute, there are no ""illegitimate"" children.  Still, the gist is correct; if the father is not on the birth certificate, and no paternity or custody proceeding was ever filed, then technically you have sole custody, and the relocation statute (NRS 125C.200) does not, technically, apply.  That said, you still can't simply leave -- that is because, for the next six months, the place with sole jurisdiction to hear a custody and visitation case will be Nevada, so if you move to TX, and dad is upset about it, he can file an action that will pull you back here to defend.  For an explanation, see the article titled ""The Basics of Family Law Jurisdiction,"" on the Published Works page of our firm web site, at http://www.willicklawgroup.com/published_works.

567481,404591,"I'm curious to know why you mention that you were hit in the crosswalk of a major chain store.  I infer that you consider the store partially liable.  That would change how you handle the claim, if that is the case, because it would bring a different kind of insurance into play - and probably an out of state insurance adjuster.   We'll need to know whether you or a resident relative of yours has automobile insurance.  If so, then report the claim to them; but don't agree to be interrogated (or recorded) by an adjuster there yet.  We'll also need to learn about the insurance for the car's owner and driver.  Finally, we'll want to know the insurance info from the store, if it shares in liability.  The first source of payments for your medical bills should be PIP (automobile) insurance.  If the store is also liable, then it may have Medical Payments benefits which would also come into play.  If you have health insurance, be advised that your insurer is likely to be entitled to be reimbursed for the money that it spends for your related medical care; but the reimbursement might not be dollar for dollar.  When you make your claim to the at-fault party(ies), you will be making claims for past and future pain and suffering, mental anguish, loss of capacity for enjoyment of life, inconvenience, lost wages / diminished earnings capacity, scarring & disfigurement, and medical expenses.  If we can't get the at-fault parties' insurers to settle out of court for a reasonable amount of money, then you'll need to decide whether the case would be economically viable to take to court.  Personal injury cases are expensive to take to trial; but your attorneys usually front those costs.

It would be important, however, to review many factors and to consider if it is worth the total cost if your home is worth less than the loan balance(s).

Most will provide a free consultation to give you some ideas of how you can handle the situation. While most attorneys these days do concentrate in one specific area, there is nothing absurd about the suggestion that someone might handle both types of cases.  If you go to a larger law firm, they might have different departments to handle each type of case.  Spend a little time, look around and get some advice.  This is not something to ignore.

579947,409623,"You will want to find yourself an experienced attorney who handles criminal cases involving domestic violence related matters. Not all lawyers handle these types of cases. And, you can either be represented by the NH Public Defender, and can request that a Public Defender be appointed, or you can locate a private attorney on your own.   If you elect to go with the Public Defender, you only pay back to the State of NH what you can afford, based on filing a Financial Affidavit with the Office of Cost Containment. The advantage is no upfront cost of a retainer. The disadvantage is that most Public Defenders have large case loads and often cannot provide the same individual attention you might receive from a private lawyer.  If you elect to go with a private attorney, you will probably have the option of paying a flat rate or paying a retainer, being billed hourly for work done.  In deciding which option to take, it makes sense to ask the lawyer how many hours they think they will need to complete the job, as you might be better off paying a flat rate, although more expensive at the beginning of the case.  If you don't know where to go for a private lawyer, there are lots of places to look, like Avvo.   Another option is to contact the NH Bar Association Lawyer Referral Program at (603) 229-0002, you can send them an email at lrsreferral@nhbar.org, or you can go to a website and click on an online referral request form at the following web address: https://www.nhbar.org/lawyer-referral/lrs_request.asp.  It is usually the case that the cost of such a referral is $25.00.    If you believe you cannot afford an attorney at market rates, the NH Bar Association also has a Reduced Fee Program. You can contact this program by calling (603) 715-3290, you can send an email to them at reducedfee@nhbar.org, or you can go to a website and click on an online referral request for at the following web address: https://www.nhbar.org/lawyer-referral/reducedrequest.asp. Please note that lawyers who participate in these programs pay a fee to join.  If you believe you cannot afford to pay for an attorney, but still wish to have an attorney, the NH Bar Association also provides a Pro Bono Program, which provides attorneys for people who qualify based on established income guidelines. To apply for this program, you need to call the Legal Advice and Referral Center by calling 800-639-5290 or (603) 224-3333.","2011-01-26 16:20:15","2012-04-25 09:56:02",299817,299817,"Flagged as spam by akismet.","71.181.70.18",3,0,2,0,NULL,1,3.5,0
580785,411886,"First, read the consignment contract to determine what the dealer was supposed to do.  I am surprised that the dealer did not require a cashier's check or cash.  Also, the dealer should have required proof of insurance, and had the insurer add the dealer as an additional insured just in case of theft or accident.  Hopefully, the dealer is reputable, and has made adequate provision for the sales transaction.  If the dealer did not do what I indicated above, you may have a claim against the dealer.  This dealer may have posted a motor vehicle dealer's bond, against which you can make a claim.    For more information on motor vehicle bonds, you can review the following web site:  http://www.jwsuretybonds.com/surety-bonds/commercial-bonds/auto_dealer_bond.htm  Depending on the amount of the transaction, you may be able to sue (if need be) in small claims court.  The jurisdictional maximum for small claims court is $10,000.    Be sure to keep paying the car note (if a payment is due), so that your credit is not damaged, and the note does not go into default.  Your lender should account properly for payments received versus the outstanding balance owed, and issue a refund of any overpayment (if any).  You should write by certified mail to the dealer to set out the facts and request that the dealer address and resolve this matter.  Your letter may end up being evidence in a subsequent suit.  Also, you may wish to consider filing a complaint with the Texas Attorney General.  The Texas Attorney General complaints web address is:  https://www.oag.state.tx.us/consumer/complain.shtml  Incidentally, when someone really sells a vehicle in Texas, they should file a vehicle transfer notification with the Department of Motor Vehicles. Otherwise, the title may never be transferred out of the seller's name, and the seller (still the owner in the eyes of the DMV) would be liable for traffic tickets, parking tickets, etc. The web address for this information at the DMV is:  https://vision21.txdot.gov/Vehicle/MainTransferNotification.aspx  Good luck.

583110,411689,"Your complaint is about problems with the vehicle that it sounds like you think the dealer should take care of for you. The real question is whether or not the dealer is required to do that in your state because if not, then there may be nothing you can do to make them do it or to pay for it. If the dealer is not required to do anything for you, then you may be stuck. In a used car sale, your legal rights are mostly determined by the paperwork that you sign. Look to see if anything was written down about any kind of warranty or guarantee or right to cancel the deal. If so, then that may be binding on both you and the dealer. When you bought it can matter too. If you bought it very recently (and 8 months is borderline in most cases), then you may have more legal rights (again, depending on your paperwork and what representations were made to you when you bought it). But that’s still not the end of it. There’s also a federal law that requires all car dealers to post on the window of all used cars they are selling a special ""Buyer Guide” form (it’s often called a Used Car Window Sticker) that discloses whether or not a warranty comes with the car. Many small lot car dealers don’t comply with the law. If they don’t, then you may end up with a warranty after all and you may even have the right to cancel the sale. The back side of the form has to be completely filled out and many car lots, big and small, fail to do that too and that can also trigger your right to cancel the deal. You can see what the Buyer Guide form looks like on this web site page: http://ohiolemonlaw.com/used-car-lemon-law.html . The only way to know for sure what your legal rights are is for you to talk to a local Consumer Law attorney who deals with this kind of case (it's called ""autofraud"" or car sales fraud). Call your local attorney's Bar Association and ask for a referral to a Consumer Law attorney near you or you can go to this web site page for a Free Online 50 State National List of Consumer Law Lawyers (http://www.ohiolemonlaw.com/ocll-site/ocll-locate_local.shtml) and find one near you (lawyers don’t pay to get listed here and most of them are members of the only national association for Consumer Law lawyers, NACA.net).

Only personal service on her, in the proper manner, wherever she is found can accomplish this.

Do keep in the the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA http://www.military.com/benefits/legal-matters/scra/overview) .  Become well acquainted with it, as it gives you specific rights, some of which may affect the manner and timing of how you proceed with the divorce.  Later, if there are custody issues, or support determinations, SCRA will come into play, but only if it is invoked by you.  Talk to your attorney about your specific situation, especially if you only recently received your deployment order.   If you do not have an attorney, get one, preferably not JAG (no offense).  An experienced local attorney would be what I advise.  The advice given about estate issues and preparation is a good one.

In order to clear up this warrant you should hire an experienced California DUI attorney.  Your DUI attorney can appear in Court on your behalf and recall the warrant.  Further, as long as you never appeared in Court your experienced DUI attorney can file a Serna Motion and try to get the matter dismissed due to the age of the case.  A Serna Motion can be filed anytime more than one year has passed from the filing of the complaint and the date of arraignment.  The Court typically looks to see if the Defendant has suffered actual prejudice by this delay in prosecution.  It is likely that actual prejudice can be shown in that memories fade, the officer may not still be employed by the arresting agency, and/or if you submitted to a blood sample the sample could have been destroyed.

598527,421166,"It looks like you are talking about a used car. In a used car sale in almost all states, your legal rights are mostly determined by the paperwork that you sign. The miles on the car when you buy it can make a difference in those few states that require dealers to give a minimal warranty on used cars they sell.  A local lawyer can tell you if your state law requires that. Otherwise, when problems arise after the sale, first look to see if anything was written down about any kind of warranty or guarantee or right to cancel the deal. But that’s not the end of it. There’s also a federal law that requires all car dealers to post on the window of all used cars they are selling a special ""Buyer Guide” form (it’s often called a Used Car Window Sticker) that discloses whether or not a warranty comes with the car. Many small lot car dealers don’t comply with the law. If they don’t, then you may end up with a warranty after all (even if you think your sale was ""as is”) and you may even have the right to cancel the sale. The back side of the form has to be completely filled out and many car lots, big and small, fail to do that too and that can also trigger your right to cancel the deal. You can see what the Buyer Guide form looks like on this web site page: http://ohiolemonlaw.com/used-car-lemon-law.html . Before you decide to buy a used car read this Avvo.com guide on ""How to Avoid Buying a Lemon Used Car in 7 Steps”: http://www.avvo.com/legal-guides/ugc/how-to-avoid-buying--lemon-used-car-in-7-steps. Once you have already spent your money, it's not too late to have an independent repair shop inspect it and tell you what they think, but the best time is before you put down your hard earned money. To find out what your rights are in your state, you need to talk to a local Consumer Law attorney who deals with this kind of case (it's called ""autofraud"" or car sales fraud). Call your local attorney's Bar Association and ask for a referral to a Consumer Law attorney near you or you can go to this web site page for a Free Online 50 State National List of Consumer Law Lawyers (http://www.ohiolemonlaw.com/ocll-site/ocll-locate_local.shtml) and find one near you (lawyers don’t pay to get listed here and most of them are members of the only national association for Consumer Law lawyers, NACA.net). But act quickly because for every legal right you have, there is only a limited amount of time to actually file a lawsuit in court or your rights expire (it's called the statute of limitations), so don't waste your time getting to a Consumer Law attorney and finding out what your rights are. You might find this Avvo Legal Guide helpful on ""How to Buy a Used Car & Not Get Ripped Off” in the future: http://www.avvo.com/legal-guides/ugc/how-to-buy-a-used-car-and-not-get-ripped-off.

603239,423725,"I agree that more information would be helpful regarding the jail time that you served.  I am assuming that the first time you were arrested it was because you came in contact with law enforcement and they arrested you for an outstanding warrant for violating your probation.   I am assuming once you appeared in Court the judge recalled the warrant and you admitted you were in violation of probation and the Court reinstated you on probation with the same sentencing terms to remain.  I am assuming that since you did not complete any of the terms, you came in contact with law enforcement and you were arrested due to the warrant for violating the terms of your probation again and now you have a Court date in March.  At your March Court date the Court can decide to reinstate you on probation and add additional sentencing terms (i.e. custody, work release, etc.), or the Court can determine that you haven't taken care of this matter in 3 years and the Court can max you out on the offense and require you to serve custody time and terminate the probation.  Thus, once you have served your custody time, you will not be on probation for this case.  Even though the Court may not require the alcohol program, the DMV will still require you to complete a program to get your driver's license back.  In this case, it might be your best option to terminate probation and just serve the custody time and see if the Court will convert the fine amount to custody time.

When another person caused the damage to your vehicle or totaled your vehicle, you are entitled by law to be placed in the same position you were in had the accident not happened. Thus, you are entitled to be placed back in whatever vehicle you had that was damaged in the accident. If the Insurance company says it is worth $5,000 and you cannot buy one for less than $8,000, then tell them you would be happy for them to go out and buy the vehicle for you.   Just be sure that whatever amount the give you will be the amount needed to put you back in the same exact vehicle, not to mention extra money for inconvenience.

3097922,1469509,"The terms of your written contract will control.  In California, a person has four years to bring a claim for breach of a written contract under Cal. Civ. Pro. § 337.  Additionally, a claimant has a duty to mitigate his damages (i.e. claimant cannot allow the damage to get worse as a result of inaction).    That being said, you should consult an attorney to determine if there are valid claims for breach by the painter.  For example, was there a contractual provision regarding performance of work, adhering to standards in the industry, not causing damage to your home, etc.?  It is unclear from your question whether the painter misapplied paint (or other material) resulting in damage or if the painter did something else unrelated to the contract to cause damage.     Another thing to consider is whether there is an attorneys’ fees provision in the contract entitling the prevailing party to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees.    If there is an attorneys’ fees provision in your signed contract, it behooves you to speak to an attorney.    You need to speak to an attorney about the terms in your contract and any legal theories (and defenses) available to you.  Given the fact you say $16,000 in damages has occurred, this likely will not be a case for small claims court where the limit per claim is $10,000.

4217091,1850059,"First of all, you should not admit to criminal activity on Avvo.com.  The facts here do not demonstrate that you have committed the crime of robbery in North Carolina. Based on what you have briefly stated, you are likely guilty of felony larceny or misdemeanor larceny.  The offense of common law robbery is defined as the ""(1) felonious, non-consensual taking of (2) money or other personal property (3) from the person or presence of another (4) by means of force.” State v. Staten, ___ N.C. App. ___, ___, 616 S.E.2d 650, 660 (2005). Here, you have not demonstrated that you used any force or a threat of force in committing the crime. Also, you have not stated that you have taken the headphones from a person.  All robberies in NC are felony offenses. Larceny from a person, larceny of goods worth over $1000, and second larceny convictions are felonies in NC.  Pursuant to G.S. 14-72(a), ""[l]arceny of goods of the value of more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) is a Class H felony. The receiving or possessing of stolen goods of the value of more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) while knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that the goods are stolen is a Class H felony. Larceny as provided in subsection (b) of this section is a Class H felony. Receiving or possession of stolen goods as provided in subsection (c) of this section is a Class H felony. Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, larceny of property, or the receiving or possession of stolen goods knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe them to be stolen, where the value of the property or goods is not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000), is a Class 1 misdemeanor. In all cases of doubt, the jury shall, in the verdict, fix the value of the property stolen.""  If the headphones were worth under $1000, you didn't take them from a person, and you were never convicted of larceny in the past, the crime may be a Class 1 misdemeanor which is punishable by a suspended sentence of upto 45 days and community probation for first time offenders. There may be deferred prosecution programs available for first time offenders for this charge.  If the headphones were worth over $1000, or if you took them from a person, you would be guilty of a Class H felony. A class H felony is punishable by a minimum active or suspended sentence of 4-8 months. A defendant may be placed on community probation or intermediate probation or be sent to a correctional facility by a judge for this offense. Sometimes, deferred prosecution agreements are also available for first time offenders for this offense as well.  Furthermore, since you said you were ""involved with 3 more boys"", you may be guilty of the crime of conspiracy. Under G.S. 14-2.4, unless a different classification is expressly stated in statute, a conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor is punishable under the next lower classification of the offense which the offender conspired to commit. Unless a different classification is expressly stated in statute, a conspiracy to commit a felony is punishable under the next lower classification of the offense which the offender conspired to commit.  Each one of the 3 other participants will likely be responsible for the larceny and possibly for a conspiracy.","2014-08-19 16:50:49","2014-09-11 21:03:21",2130892,1632650,"9/11/14 atty req removal- la","77.247.181.162",3,0,NULL,0,NULL,1,7.5,0
